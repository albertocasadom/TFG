Conducting experiments\r\n         with several countermeasures.\n\nThe learning objective of this lab is for students to gain the first-hand\nexperience on buffer-overflow vulnerability by putting what they have learned\nabout the vulnerability from class into actions.\nBuffer overflow is defined as the condition in which a program attempts to\nwrite data beyond the boundaries of pre-allocated fixed length buffers. This\nvulnerability can be utilized by a malicious user to alter the flow control of\nthe program, even execute arbitrary pieces of code. This vulnerability arises\ndue to the mixing of the storage for data (e.g. buffers) and the\nstorage for controls (e.g. return addresses): an overflow in the data part can\naffect the control flow of the program, because an overflow can\nchange the return address.\n\n\nActivities:  Students are given a program that has the buffer-overflow\nproblem, and they need to exploit the vulnerability\nto gain the root privilege. Moreover, students will\nexperiment with several protection schemes that have been implemented in Linux,\nand evaluate their effectiveness.\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Wenliang Du, Syracuse University\n",

A common way to exploit a buffer-overflow vulnerability is\nto overflow the buffer with a malicious shellcode, and then cause the\nvulnerable program to jump to the shellcode that is stored in the stack. To\nprevent this kind of attacks, some operating systems, such as Fedora Linux,\nallow system administrators to make stacks non-executable; therefore, jumping to\nthe shellcode will cause the program to fail.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the above protection scheme is not fool-proof; there\nexists another type of attacks, the return-to-libc attack, which\ndoes not need an\nexecutable stack; it does not even use shell code. Instead, it causes the\nvulnerable program to jump to some existing code, such as the\nsystem() function in the libc library, which is\nalready loaded into the memory.\n\n\nIn this lab, students are given a program with a buffer-overflow\nvulnerability; their task is to develop a\nreturn-to-libc attack to exploit\nthe vulnerability and finally to gain the root privilege.\nIn addition to the attacks, students will be guided to\nwalk through several protection\nschemes that have been implemented in Linux to counter against\nthe buffer-overflow attacks. Students need to evaluate whether the schemes work\nor not and explain why.\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Wenliang Du, Syracuse University\n",

This is called\negress filtering.\nFor example, to prevent work-time distraction, many companies set up their egress firewalls\nto block social network sites, so their employee cannot access those sites\nfrom inside their network. For political reasons, many countries set up egress filtering at their\nISPs to block their people from accessing\nselected foreign web sites. Unfortunately, these firewalls can be easily\nbypassed, and services/products that help users bypass firewalls are widely\navailable on the Internet. The most commonly used technology to bypass\negress firewalls is Virtual Private Network (VPN).\nIn particular, this technology is widely used by smartphone users that are affected by\negress filtering; there are many VPN apps (for Android, iOS, and other\nplatforms) that can help users bypass egress firewalls.\n\n\nThe learning objective of this lab is for students to see\nhow VPN works in action and how VPN can help bypass egress firewalls.\nWe will implement a very simple VPN in this lab, and use it to bypass\nfirewalls. A typical VPN depends on two pieces of technologies: IP tunneling\nand encryption. The tunneling technology is the most essential one to help\nbypass firewalls; the encryption technology is for protecting the content\nof the traffic that goes through the VPN tunnel.\nFor the sake of simplicity, we will only focus on the tunneling part,\nso the traffic inside our tunnel is not encrypted. We have a separate\nVPN lab, which covers both tunneling and encryption. If readers are\ninterested, they can work on our VPN lab to learn how to build a complete\nVPN. In this lab, we only focus on how to use VPN tunnel to bypass firewalls.\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Wenliang Du, Syracuse University\n",

Unfortunately,\na sequence of random numbers may be good for Monte Carlo simulation, but\nthey may be bad for encryption keys. Developers need to know how to\ngenerate secure random numbers, or they will make mistakes. Similar\nmistakes have been made in some well-known products, including\nNetscape and Kerberos.\n\n\nIn this lab, students will learn why the typical\nrandom number generation method is not appropriate for generating\nsecrets, such as encryption keys. They will further learn\na standard way to generate pseudo random numbers that are good for security purposes.\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Wenliang Du, Syracuse University\n",

The fundamental problem is\nthat there is no easy way to verify the ownership of a public key, i.e., given a public key and\nits claimed owner information, how do we ensure that the public key is indeed owned by\nthe claimed owner? The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a practical solution\nto this problem.\n\n\nThe learning objective of this lab is for students to gain the first-hand\nexperience on PKI. SEED labs have a series of labs focusing on the public-key cryptography, and\nthis one focuses on PKI. By doing the tasks in this lab, students should be able to gain a\nbetter understanding of how PKI works, how PKI is used to protect the Web, and\nhow Man-in-the-middle attacks can be defeated by PKI. Moreover, students will be able to\nunderstand the root of the trust in the public-key infrastructure, and what problems\nwill arise if the root trust is broken. \n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Wenliang Du, Syracuse University\n",

Users can be easily fooled, because\nit is hard to notice the difference between the modified app and the\noriginal app. Once the modified apps are installed, the malicious code\ninside can conduct attacks, usually in the background.\nFor example, in March 2011, it was found that DroidDream Trojan had\nbeen embedded into more than 50 apps in Android official market and had\ninfected many users. DroidDream Trojan exploits vulnerabilities in Android\nto gain the root access on the device.\n\n\nThe learning objective of this lab is for students to gain a first-hand\nexperience in Android repackaging attack, so they can better understand\nthis particular risk associated with Android systems, and be more cautious\nwhen downloading apps to their devices, especially from those untrusted\nthird-party markets. In this lab, students will be\nasked to conduct a simple repackage attack on a selected app, and\ndemonstrate the attack only on our provided Android VM. Students should be warned not to\nsubmit their repackaged apps to any market, or they will face legal\nconsequence. Nor should they run the attack on their own Android devices,\nas that may cause real damages.\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Wenliang Du, Syracuse University\n",

This is fine for normal customers, but for users who want to make\ndeep customizations on their devices, this is too restrictive. There are\nways to overcome these restrictions, most of which require the root\nprivilege on the device. The process of gaining the root device on Android\ndevices is called rooting. Being able to root Android devices is a\nvery useful skill for security experts.\n\n\nThe objective of this lab is two-fold. First, through this lab, students\nwill get familiar with the process of device rooting and understand why\ncertain steps are needed. Many people can root Android devices, but not\nmany people fully understand why things have to be done in a particular\nway. Second, the entire rooting mechanism involves\nmany pieces of knowledge about the Android system and operating system in\ngeneral, so it serves as a great vehicle for students to gain such in-depth\nsystem knowledge. In this lab, we will ask students to develop a complete rooting\npackage from scratch, and demonstrate how to use the package to root the\nAndroid VM provided by us.\n\nLab Tasks \n\t(Description)\n\n\nVM version:\nIn addtion to the SEEDUbuntu16.04 VM\n\nLab Tasks \n\t(Description)\n\n\nVM version:\nIn addtion to the SEEDUbuntu16.04 VM\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Wenliang Du, Syracuse University\n",
